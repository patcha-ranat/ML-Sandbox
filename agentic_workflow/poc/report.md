# Loan Application Data Analysis Report

## Identified Tables and Columns

The following tables and columns contain useful information regarding loan applications:

- **table_a**: 
  - Columns: 
    - `M`: Primary Key
    - `N`: Applicant Name
    - `O`: Loan Amount

- **table_b**: 
  - Columns: 
    - `P`: Primary Key (Approval Status)
    - `R`: Approval Date

- **table_d**: 
  - Columns: 
    - `S`: Payment Status
    - `T`: Payment Date

## Missing Information

- **table_d** is currently missing. This table is important as it contains columns `S` and `T`, which have meaningful significance for business use cases related to loans. The absence of this table may lead to incomplete or inaccurate analysis.

### Timeline for Acquiring Missing Information

- The timeline for acquiring the missing table_d depends on the availability of resources and the complexity of retrieving or reconstructing the data. Coordination with the data management team is advised to establish a realistic timeline.

## Draft SQL Code for Data Aggregation

```sql
-- Draft SQL code for data aggregation related to loan applications

SELECT 
    a.M AS Loan_Application_ID,
    a.N AS Applicant_Name,
    a.O AS Loan_Amount,
    b.P AS Approval_Status,
    b.R AS Approval_Date,
    d.S AS Payment_Status,
    d.T AS Payment_Date
FROM 
    table_a a
JOIN 
    table_b b ON a.M = b.P -- Assuming column P in table_b is a foreign key referencing Loan_Application_ID
JOIN 
    table_d d ON a.M = d.S -- Assuming column S in table_d is a foreign key referencing Loan_Application_ID
WHERE 
    b.R IS NOT NULL -- Filter to include only approved loans
GROUP BY 
    a.M, a.N, a.O, b.P, b.R, d.S, d.T
ORDER BY 
    a.M;
```

## Limitations

1. The current SQL draft assumes that the relationships between tables are based on the Loan_Application_ID.
2. If additional columns or tables are required for more detailed analysis, new data sources need to be ingested.
3. The current aggregation strategy is basic and may need to be refined based on specific business requirements.
4. The timeline for ingesting new data sources is approximately 2 days per table.
