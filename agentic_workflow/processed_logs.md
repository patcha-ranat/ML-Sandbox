## Task: Answer the question: which tables and columns have useful information about loan application? and I need timeline if there's missing information. And I also want a draft of SQL code for data aggregation, if you don't know, delegate to other agents for help and aggregate that information to wrtie output. You are coordinator between agents and user, transferring requirements and information between data engineer, domain leader. Your another responsibility is to write down markdown output file for user. You do not know technical aspect, both coding or business domain. Write down output with the best answer from data engineer and domain lead, analyzed and rearrange for comprehensive by You. 
1. Start by clearly defining the question to be answered: Identify which tables and columns contain useful information regarding loan applications. 2. Reach out to the Financial Loan Domain Leader for initial insights about relevant tables and columns. Document their input. 3. Based on the Domain Leader's feedback, compile a list of possible tables and columns. 4. Assess the completeness of the gathered data and identify any missing information that may affect the analysis. Prepare a timeline to acquire any missing information. 5. If further assistance is needed, consult the Financial Loan Data Engineer to generate SQL code that can aggregate the relevant data from the identified tables and columns. Ensure that SQL code includes a strategy for data aggregation related to loan applications. 6. Combine and analyze all responses, contextualize them, and structure findings in markdown format. 7. Create a markdown output file for the user that includes: a clear description of identified tables/columns, timeline for missing data, SQL code draft, and any limitations in the data.

## Task: Which tables and columns contain useful information about loan applications?


# Agent: Financial Loan Domain Leader
## Final Answer: 
For analyzing loan applications, the relevant information can be found in the following tables and columns:  
- **table_a**: This table is related to customer profile history, which is crucial for understanding the background of the loan applicants. The columns 'M' (Primary Key), 'N', and 'O' are useful for this purpose.  
- **table_b**: This table contains information about the transactions of customer loan requests. The columns 'P' (Primary Key) and 'R' are relevant for loan applications, while column 'Q' is not useful in this context.
- **table_d**: Although currently missing, this table is important as it contains columns 'S' and 'T', which have meaningful significance for business use cases related to loans.

These tables and columns should be utilized for data aggregation and analysis of loan applications.

# Agent: Financial Loan Domain Leader
## Task: Is there any missing information in the identified tables and columns that may affect the analysis of loan applications? If so, what is the timeline to acquire this missing information?


# Agent: Financial Loan Domain Leader
## Final Answer:
Based on the identified tables and columns related to loan applications, there is a critical missing piece of information. Table_d, which contains columns 'S' and 'T', is missing. These columns have meaningful significance to the business use case of loan applications. Without this table, the analysis of loan applications may be incomplete or inaccurate. It is essential to acquire this missing information to ensure a comprehensive analysis. The timeline for acquiring this missing information would depend on the availability of resources and the complexity of retrieving or reconstructing the data. It is advisable to coordinate with the data management team to assess the situation and establish a realistic timeline for acquiring the missing table_d.
