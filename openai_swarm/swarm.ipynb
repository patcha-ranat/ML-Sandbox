    "# Research on OpenAI Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Official GitHub - openai - swarm: https://github.com/openai/swarm?tab=readme-ov-file*\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it is\n",
    "- Orchestrator of AI agents (LLMs)\n",
    "- Each agent can use a different model ***that are only available on OpenAI***\n",
    "- Can be used though Python API as a client session\n",
    "- Stateless\n",
    "    - Can't work across multiple sessions\n",
    "    - Reduce overhead of managing persistent states\n",
    "    - High computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Minimal Codebase + Lightweight + The cleanest Multi-agent framework.\n",
    "- It's proper as a starting point for learners to learn about Multi-agent frameworks, giving a sense of how multi-agent framework generally looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "- It's not mature as other tools, suited for multi-agent POC.\n",
    "- It's for educational purposes (OpenAI does not actively support the framework).\n",
    "- It's more for multi-agent prototyping.\n",
    "- There's a cost from using OpenAI API for models utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives:\n",
    "- **CrewAI**: *(The community claimed to be the most similar to OpenAI Swarm, but better and suited for production-scale LLM application)*\n",
    "- **Langroid**: *(Claimed by library maintainer to be a better choice compared with Langgraph)*\n",
    "- **Langgraph**: *(It's upgraded Langchain with cleaner workflows and visualization as a graph for agents working process)*\n",
    "- **AutoGen**\n",
